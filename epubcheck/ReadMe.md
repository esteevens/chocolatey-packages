EPUBCheck is a tool to validate the conformance of EPUB publications against the EPUB specifications.
EPUBCheck can be run as a standalone command-line tool or used as a Java library.

EPUBCheck is open source software, maintained by the [DAISY Consortium](http://www.daisy.org) on behalf of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck_fundraising).

## Documentation

Documentation on how to **use** EPUBCheck, to **contribute** to the project or to **translate** messages is available on the [EPUBCheck wiki](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck/wiki).

Financial support is critical to the development of EPUBCheck, the tool we all use to validate EPUB files.
We need to make sure that the resources are adequate to both update the tool and provide for its continued maintenance over the next two years;
